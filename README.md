## Running Code with Docker Compose

This repository contains code that can be easily run using Docker Compose. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services and then runs those services with a single command.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker: Install Docker
Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose
How to Run
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```
Navigate into the cloned directory:
```
cd your-repo
```
Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will build the Docker images (if not already built) and start the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

Once the containers are up and running, you can access your application.

To stop the containers, use:
```
docker-compose down
```
